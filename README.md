GitHub, a platform of code,

Where developers convene and unload,

Their projects big and small,

A virtual hub for them all.



With tools to manage and track,

The progress of their work in back,

And features that make it divine,

A true treasure trove for the tech-savvy kind.



Here, open source is king,

A place for sharing and growing things,

From small scripts to full-fledged apps,

GitHub's impact on the tech world snaps.



So here's to GitHub, may it thrive,

A home for all who love to code and jive,

With a community that's second to none,

A true crown jewel for all who've begun.
